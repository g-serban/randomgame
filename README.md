# randomgame
guess a random number but using a terminal/ command prompt

Using a terminal/ command prompt/ powershell:

1. Go to the directory where you have randomgame.py downloaded

2. Now you have to choose 2 numbers so that the computer can select one between them (let's say between 1, 10)

for linux/mac in terminal: python3 randomgame.py number1 number2

for windows: python randomgame.py number1 number2

3. Now you are going to get prompted to input your guess. Enter a number until you guess right!
